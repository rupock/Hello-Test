The ability to collaborate and contribute to projects is an essential skill for any software developer. Collaboration often involves making changes on ones' local repository and submitting those modifications to the main, or 'origin', repo via a Pull Request. These are the steps involved:
Create a new local branch by using the command: git checkout -b 
[branch_name]
.
Stage and commit changes by using git commit -m "
[message]
"
To push your local branch to the remote, you use git push 
origin
 [branch_name].
Finally, submit a pull request via GitHub's interface.
